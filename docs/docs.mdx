import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-reflection" />

## Usage

The `Reflection` component simply wraps the content to be reflected.

<Demo data={demos.configurator} />

## The Image tag

The `img` tag requires to be in `display: block` in order to avoid padding below it. For this reason, a `style` has been added to force the behavior.

<Demo data={demos.simpleImage} />

## Components

You may use the `Reflection` component to reflect other components.

<Demo data={demos.component} />

## Complex components

For complex components, you may need to disable certain components to prevent the mirrored version from functioning as a copy. In this example, we used the prop `disableChildren` for the right component. Mouse click is always disabled via CSS, but moving with the TAB key will focus on the mirrored component.
